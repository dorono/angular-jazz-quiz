This is a very simple app I made to get a glimpse of what you can do with Angular. I have another repo in my account here with another version of this quiz built using good ole-fashioned jQuery, but it doesn't compare in terms of efficiency and cleanliness to what you get with Angular.

I am using a flat JSON file as my data source, but of course, at some point I'd throw all of the dynamic content into a database and grab it that way.

I built this using Grunt plus lots of plugins including SASS/Compass, so aside from the html files, all of my js and css is in the dev/js and dev/sass directories.
